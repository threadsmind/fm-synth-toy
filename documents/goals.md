# Goals
make a neat little modular FM synth toy that will probably perform terribly in a browser

## stuff to do
* connect any number of osc modules (maybe limited number for performance?).
* oscs can function as LFO connected to gain, frequency, and other params.
* maybe add effects, but low priority.
* create envelopes for any parameter of any osc/gain channel.
* some sort of UI.
  * drag and drop if possible / not super annoying.
  * option to show / hide all most modules (allowing the user to focus on one module).
* single note player in module screen for testing sound.
* export / save synth parameters.
* separate screen / tab with a single octave player.
  * map notes to keyboard keys? custom keybinds?
  * click to play.
  * buttons to shift octaves.
  * set base pitch (does the octave go C->C or F#->F#).
* separate screen / tab for a small sequencer.
  * export / save sequence.
